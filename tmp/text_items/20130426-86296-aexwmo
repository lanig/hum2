  <h2>Orange Juice</h2>
  <p>Oranges have Vitamin C, flavinoid and beta-carotene to prevent ageing, strengthen the immune system and raise
    resistance against sickness and cancer.</p>

  <img src="/images/recipes/orange-juice.jpg" class="left" alt="orange juice" />
  <img src="/images/recipes/orange-juice-steps.jpg" alt="orange juice" />
  <ol>
    <li>Peel the fruit and cut into sixths.</li>
    <li>You can use either strainer - the finer one will result in a clearer juice</li>
    <li>Put the prepared orange pieces into the Slow Juicer</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="tip">TIP: If you put the extracted orange juice through the Slow Juicer a second time, the juice becomes clearer and there is less residue left in the strainer</p>
</div>

















<h2>Grape Juice</h2>
<p>The purple colour of the grape juice is caused by the presence of flavonoids which can prevent blood clots, strengthen the heart and promote muscular strength. Also present are pectins and tannins which are great for the digestive system.</p>
<img src="/images/recipes/grape-juice.png" class="right" alt="Grape Juice" />
<ol>
  <li>Wash and separate the grapes individually and put into the Slow Juicer.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: Don't run extracted grapes through the Slow Juicer a second time as this may damage the machine.</p>
<img src="/images/recipes/grape-juice-steps.png" class="recipe-steps" alt="Grape Juice" />
<p class="tip">TIP: The surface of a well-ripened grape may be covered with a white powder. It is beneficial to pick the grape with the white powder evenly distributed.</p>

<h2>Strawberry Juice</h2>
<p>Strawberries are high in Vitamin C, a key ingredient for cell healing, detoxifying. One serving - around eight strawberries - contains more than an orange and will provide your recommended daily dose.</p>
<img src="/images/recipes/strawberry-juice.png" class="right" alt="Strawberry Juice" />
<ol>
  <li>Wash strawberries and leave the stem attached.</li>
  <li>Put the prepared strawberries into the Slow Juicer</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/recipes/strawberry-juice-steps.png" class="recipe-steps" alt="Strawberry Juice" />
<p class="tip">TIP: Put the whole strawberry including the stem into the Slow Juicer. It is not only less troublesome, but the juice is extracted better.</p>

<h2>Apple Juice</h2>
<p>Apples are abundant in vitamins and minerals and are a great source of fibre. They can assist digestion and absorption of iron and contain citric acid which relieves stress and fatigue.</p>
<img src="/images/recipes/apple-juice.png" class="right" alt="Strawberry Juice" />
<ol>
  <li>Wash apples and leave the peel on</li>
  <li>Cut apple into sixths and remove the core</li>
  <li>Put the prepared apple into the Slow Juicer</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/recipes/apple-juice-steps.png" class="recipe-steps" alt="Strawberry Juice" />
<p class="tip">TIP: Use the white strainer to produce a clearer juice. The type of apples and the season may affect the speed of juicing and amount of foam.</p>


<h2>Kiwi Juice</h2>
<p>Kiwis are abundant in Vitamin C which can help controls ageing and prevent cancer and cataracts. It is helpful in smoothing skin and stress and is also good for smokers</p>
<img src="/images/recipes/kiwi-juice.png" class="right" alt="Kiwi Juice" />
<ol>
  <li>Lightly brush the kiwi with a brush to remove the fine hairs and cut into quarters with the peel on</li>
  <li>Put the prepared kiwi into the slow juicer</li>
  <li>The kiwi peel is extracted through the separate output</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/recipes/kiwi-juice-steps.png" class="recipe-steps" alt="Kiwi Juice" />
<p class="tip">TIP: Gold kiwi v green kiwi. There are two different colours of kiwi and the nutrients in each differs slightly. The green kiwi is more sour and good for dietary purposes. The gold kiwi is sweet and is a good snack for picky kids that need vitamins and minerals</p>

<h2>Pomegranate Juice</h2>
<p>Pomegranates contain the female hormone estrogen so it is effective for women going through menopause. The seeds contain estrogen and the pulp contains vitamins to give energy and treat high  blood pressure and blood clots.</p>
<img src="/images/recipes/pomegranate-juice.png" class="right" alt="Pomegranate Juice" />
<ol>
  <li>Open the outer peel and take out the fruit</li>
  <li>Put the prepared fruit into the Slow Juicer</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/recipes/pomegranate-juice-steps.png" class="recipe-steps" alt="Pomegranate Juice" />
<p class="tip">TIP: The origin of the pomegranate may affect the color and amount of juice</p>
